**Kye** is a tech-head and software developer who has worked for 15 years across the event technologies and IT fields,
and has for the last few years been developing interactive multimedia systems.

My recent language experience has been full-stack in **Javascript (Typescript)** using **Node**, **Vue**, **Express**
and other such related libraries and frameworks.

My previous experience has included Mobile apps in **Flutter**, native in **Swift** and **Kotlin**, and 
cross-platform console and GUI apps in **Go** and **C++**.

I also have a lot of experience using software development in multimedia systems, including creating and working with
**Notch** and **TouchDesigner** projects across video, lighting, 3D and VR, and connecting with and using broadcast and professional 
events solutions such as **WatchOut**, **D3**, **E2**,etc...

I am currently employed full-time with **Great Big Events** in Sydney (www.greatbigevents.com) working on full-stack web, and on
multimedia presentation systems.
